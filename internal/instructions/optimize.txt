- optimizedMasterList:
  - This is the global list of search queries maintained by the system.
  - It reflects both system-level interests and accumulated user preferences.
  - When optimizing, never remove existing topics; instead, rephrase, merge, or extend to accommodate both past and new interests.
  - Incorporate the user’s prompt to add relevant new queries or improve phrasing, ensuring semantic coverage of all previously included scopes.
  - Each new optimization must grow or adapt the list, not shrink it.

- optimizedUserPreference:
  - This is the personalized list of search queries tailored to the user's interests.
  - It must be a logical subset of the optimizedMasterList — every entry here must also exist (exactly or semantically) in the master list.
  - Use the user's prompt to adjust their preference list, possibly introducing new queries that the master list can absorb, or pruning redundancies without losing thematic coverage.
  - This list must never cause the master list to reflect only a single user’s interest — the master list is collective, not personal.
