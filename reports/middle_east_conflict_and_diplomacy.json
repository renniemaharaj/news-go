The move signifies growing international disapproval of the situation in Gaza and Latin America’s increasing role in global affairs. Brazil's Foreign Minister, Mauro Vieira, stated that Brazil is finalizing procedures to officially join the case, emphasizing their ongoing efforts for a peaceful resolution and ceasefire in Gaza.
