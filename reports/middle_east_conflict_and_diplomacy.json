It argues this strategy has failed, leading to setbacks with Iran and Ukraine, damaging America’s global credibility. \"From the start of his second term, Trump has pursued a foreign policy grounded in displays of power and intimidation...But in practice, the strategy has run aground.\" This approach contradicts the Bible's call for peace and humility (Matthew 5:5, Romans 12:18). Readers should evaluate this analysis critically, considering biblical principles of diplomacy and ethical leadership.","images":["https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Donald-Trump.jpg"],"href":"https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/07/21/trumps-global-bully-diplomacy-the-failure-of-a-strategy-built-on-coercion/","tags":["diplomacy","politics","leadership","peace","humility"],"politicalBiases":["anti-Trump","critical of US foreign policy"]},{"title":"The \"New Middle East\" is not so new after all!","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"An analysis of the Middle East's ongoing issues, highlighting the failures of Arab states, the unchanging dynamics between Iran and Israel, and the premature talk of a 'new' Middle East. The article critiques the weakness and incompetence of Arab states in addressing the Palestinian issue and points out the historical roots of current conflicts.

It highlights the incompatibility of strategic visions, the zero-sum mindset, and the inability to address territorial issues. The author suggests micro-agreements as a potential solution. However, it lacks a faith-based perspective and fails to acknowledge God's role in resolving conflicts. As Proverbs 21:1 states, \"The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.\"","images":[],"href":"https://anewz.tv/opinions/news/10920/why-diplomacy-keeps-failing-in-ukraine/news","tags":["war","politics","russia","ukraine","peace","diplomacy","deception"],"politicalBiases":["pro-Western"]},{"title":"Saudi Arabia Pushes Regional Diplomacy After Iran and Israel Clash","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"Following a military confrontation between Iran and Israel, Saudi Arabia is asserting itself as a diplomatic actor in the Middle East, seeking to reduce tensions and open communication lines. The article highlights Saudi Arabia's diplomatic efforts, including visits to the US and Russia, and direct communication with Iranian military officials. \"Riyadh increasingly recognizes that prolonged tensions with Iran could jeopardize not only regional stability but also its own ambitious economic transformation programs.\" The article suggests a potential shift towards a new Gulf equilibrium based on mutual interest and cooperation, yet the reliance on diplomacy without acknowledging God's plan is a shaky foundation.","images":["https://www.fairobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/audi-arabia.jpg","https://www.fairobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bahram-Kalviri.jpg"],"href":"https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/saudi-arabia-pushes-regional-diplomacy-after-iran-and-israel-clash/","tags":["diplomacy","Middle East","regional stability"],"politicalBiases":["pro-Saudi","regional diplomacy"]},{"title":"Iran Confirms Fresh Talks with European Powers in Istanbul","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"Iran has agreed to meet with European powers (Britain, France, and Germany) in Istanbul to discuss its nuclear program, following strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities by the United States. Western nations and Israel have long accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, which Iran denies. The article mentions the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the potential reimposition of sanctions. This situation highlights the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the importance of seeking peaceful resolutions, as the Bible teaches us to pursue peace with all men (Romans 12:18).
