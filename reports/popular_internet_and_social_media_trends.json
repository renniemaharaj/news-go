The Viral Calm Trend Inspired by Indonesian Kid Rayyan Arkan Dikha","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This article discusses the \"Aura Farming\" trend, where people seek calm and happiness by watching videos of Rayyan Arkan Dikha, an Indonesian boy known for his gentle demeanor. While the trend promotes kindness and peace, it subtly introduces the concept of 'aura,' a form of energy that deviates from biblical truth. The Bible teaches that true peace and fulfillment come through faith in Jesus Christ, not from external sources or practices. \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\" (John 14:27, KJV). Readers are encouraged to seek lasting peace through Christ, not fleeting trends.","images":["https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_fill,d_642250b563292b35f27461a7.png,f_jpg,fl_progressive,h_375,q_auto,w_625/687ca6994d5852001db09773.jpg"],"href":"https://vocal.media/journal/what-is-aura-farming-the-viral-calm-trend-inspired-by-indonesian-kid-rayyan-arkan-dikha-oy66o0zio","tags":["peace","kindness","social media","deception"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"Latin America Music Market Report: 2025-2033","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"Report forecasts the Latin America music market to grow from USD 2 billion in 2024 to USD 4.70 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 9.96%.
