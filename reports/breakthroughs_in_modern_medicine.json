These include the Framingham Heart Study, the Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health, Oral Rehydration Therapy, CRISPR gene-editing technology, vaccines for measles/polio/COVID-19, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Human Genome Project, and Protease Inhibitors for HIV/AIDS. Dr. Francis Collins stated about the Human Genome Project, “We have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to God.” While the advancements are notable, dependence on government funding raises concerns about potential control and ethical implications, contrasting with reliance on God's provision and wisdom.","images":["https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/gty-250804-luther-terry-690x452.jpg","https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/gty-250804-craig-venter-francis-collins-690x488.jpg"],"href":"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/8-times-taxpayer-money-led-historic-leaps-medical-care-2025a1000kyx?src=rss","tags":["health","technology","ethics","government","faith"],"politicalBiases":["pro-government funding of science","academic"]},{"title":"Digital Pathology: Reaching an Inflection Point with AI","commentaries":null,"alignment":5,"summary":"This article discusses the increasing adoption of digital pathology, driven by advancements in image quality, AI, and decreasing costs. It highlights benefits such as improved workflows, remote access to expertise, and AI-powered diagnostic capabilities, quoting Andrew P. Norgan: \"We are reaching an inflection point where we are going to see much broader adoption of digital pathology.\" Challenges include costs, interoperability issues, and regulatory hurdles. While advancements in technology are not inherently unbiblical, discernment is needed to ensure these tools serve humanity in alignment with God's will, rather than replacing human compassion and judgment (1 Thessalonians 5:21).","images":["https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Aug1_2025_GettyImages_1918984526_Organelles-e1754585451608-218x150.jpg","https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Aug1_2025_GettyImages_1354171893_ResearchLabComputers-e1754531211565-696x480.jpg","https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Aug1_2025_GettyImages_2183527075-AIChip-1024x576.jpg","https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Aug1_2025_GettyImages_2187044914_ScientistsWorkingTogether-1024x682.jpg"],"href":"https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/topics/informatics/from-microscopes-to-computers-reaching-an-inflection-point-in-digital-pathology/","tags":["technology","artificial intelligence","health","innovation","discernment"],"politicalBiases":[]}],"title":"8 Times Taxpayer Money Led to Historic Leaps in Medical Care","date":"2025-08-07T16:07:38-04:00"}
