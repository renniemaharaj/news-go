Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated he would not extend the residency permit of Jonathan Whittall, head of the OCHA office in Israel, citing \"biased and hostile conduct against Israel.\" Whittall had criticized humanitarian conditions in Gaza, saying Gazans were \"slowly dying.\" This action is part of a broader trend of Israel restricting visas for UN officials since the war began in October 2023. (Source: Hindustan Times, July 21, 2025). This action reflects a potential bias against those seeking to aid Palestinians, and it is important to remember the Bible teaches, \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" - Galatians 3:28 KJV.","images":["https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/20/550x309/Israel-Palestinians-13_1753043228463_1753043250605.jpg"],"href":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-blocks-visa-for-top-un-official-after-gaza-comments-101753043190077.html","tags":["Israel","United Nations","Gaza","Politics","Humanitarian Aid","Bias","Galatians 3:28"],"politicalBiases":["Israeli Foreign Policy","UN involvement in Middle East"]},{"title":"Press TV News: Gaza Aid Seekers Massacred, Ansarullah Support, Iran Dismisses Snapback","commentaries":null,"alignment":2,"summary":"Press TV reports on the killing of Palestinian aid seekers in Gaza by Israeli forces, condemning it as a violation of human rights.
