The research emphasizes that experiencing extreme weather alone doesn't automatically lead to support for climate policies; rather, it's the belief that climate change is responsible that drives action. Policies like protecting forests and increasing renewable energy receive the most support, while carbon taxes on food and fuel are less popular. The article underscores the importance of public engagement and effective communication to connect scientific findings with public sentiment, advocating for scientists, educators, and journalists to explain the 'why' behind the weather.
