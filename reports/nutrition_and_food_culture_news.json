Deborah Olarte suggests making meals more appealing and accessible. This highlights a need for discernment in dietary choices, as Proverbs 23:2-3 warns against excessive desire for food, lest it lead to deception. \"Even when school meals are free, students don’t always take and eat them. This tells us that cost isn’t the only barrier,” said Deborah Olarte.","images":[],"href":"https://www.foodmanufacturing.com/consumer-trends/news/22946022/food-preferences-stigma-among-reasons-students-dont-eat-free-school-meals","tags":["nutrition","food","stigma","health","deception"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"Interview with Michael Shaikh: Food Culture in Conflict Zones","commentaries":null,"alignment":5,"summary":"An interview with Michael Shaikh, author of 'The Last Sweet Bite,' explores the impact of conflict and violence on food cultures. Shaikh highlights the importance of protecting culinary heritage, particularly the knowledge held by women elders, as a form of resistance against cultural erasure. He connects food policies like embargoes and land dispossession to the intentional attacks to demoralize and intimidate a community or weaken and erase it altogether. He also references Joy Harjo's poem to underscore food's connection to cultural continuity, which mirrors the Bible's emphasis on remembering God's provision and faithfulness (Deuteronomy 8:18), while encouraging interrogation of our food beyond just health and ethics. Consider how cultural authoritarianism and violence can affect something as fundamental as food and our need to remember the goodness of God.","images":["https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0004.jpeg"],"href":"https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/interview-with-michael-shaikh-author-of-the-last-sweet-bite/","tags":["food","culture","violence","heritage","political","remembrance"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"New Indian Diet Model Could Help Fight Heart Disease with Everyday Ingredients","commentaries":null,"alignment":5,"summary":"An article from Newsclick reports on a new \"Indian Adapted Mediterranean Diet\" (IAMD) developed by researchers at AIIMS. The diet substitutes traditional Mediterranean foods with local Indian ingredients to combat heart disease. The study highlights that a shift from a mildly inflammatory diet (DII score of +1.1) to the IAMD strategy resulted in a significant decrease in inflammation (DII score of -8.0). This suggests that simple dietary adjustments using familiar Indian components can lower internal inflammation, a major cause of heart disease. The article asserts that improving heart health in India may begin with the plate rather than the pharmacy. While this diet can be beneficial, reliance on diet alone without acknowledging the need for faith in Jesus Christ is insufficient (John 6:35).","images":[],"href":"https://www.newsclick.in/new-indian-diet-model-could-help-fight-heart-disease-everyday-ingredients","tags":["health","India","diet","heart disease","anti-inflammatory diet"],"politicalBiases":["India"]},{"title":"Op-Ed: Fast Food Crisis in the Virgin Islands","commentaries":null,"alignment":7,"summary":"Oliver Wilson Ottley III highlights the overabundance of unhealthy fast-food options in the Virgin Islands, leading to significant health issues like heart disease and diabetes.
