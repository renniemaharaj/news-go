It suggests eating 40-45% of your calories before 2 PM and optimizing food combinations for better absorption. The article does not align with biblical principles, as it focuses on self-optimization rather than reliance on God for health and well-being. As 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 states, \"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God? and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\"","images":[],"href":"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/1800-calorie-meal-plan-just-025547946.html","tags":["health","nutrition","self-care","body as temple"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"TikTok Bans #SkinnyTok, Impact Questionable","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"USA TODAY reports TikTok banned #SkinnyTok for promoting unrealistic body standards and eating disorders.
