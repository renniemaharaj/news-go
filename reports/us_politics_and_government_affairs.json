{"searchQuery":"US Politics and Government Affairs","results":[{"title":"Proportional Representation as a Solution to Petty Redistricting","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This R Street Institute analysis discusses the threat of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. and proposes proportional representation (PR) as a solution. It highlights how both parties redraw congressional maps for partisan gain, undermining representative government. PR, used in other countries, could mitigate gerrymandering by electing multiple winners in proportion to each party's vote share. The article suggests PR would better reflect a state’s partisan makeup. However, readers should consider that any system can be manipulated, and true representation relies on Biblical principles of justice and fairness (Micah 6:8).","images":["https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/texas-1024x489.png","https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/massachusetts-1024x489.png"],"href":"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/pr-should-stand-for-proportional-representation-not-petty-redistricting/","tags":["politics","electoral reform","justice"],"politicalBiases":["libertarian","reformist"]},{"title":"South Korea’s Role in Potential Taiwan Conflict Not on Agenda for Trump-Lee Summit","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This article discusses the upcoming summit between the US and South Korea, noting the US is expected to pressure South Korea for increased defense spending. Concerns arise from South Korea's cautious stance on China, aligning with President Lee Jae-myung's emphasis on fostering ties despite labeling Beijing a 'problem.' The article highlights that discussions will likely avoid the sensitive topic of South Korea's role in a potential Taiwan conflict. This reluctance may stem from not wanting to upset China, but as Christians, we are called to stand for righteousness and not compromise truth for political expediency. 'Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people' (Proverbs 14:34).","images":["https://img.i-scmp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,width=1024,format=auto/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/07/9f23c0b1-5673-46c4-bcd8-275591b28e80_8aaeabb4.jpg"],"href":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3321034/south-koreas-role-potential-taiwan-conflict-not-agenda-trump-lee-summit","tags":["politics","China","South Korea","Taiwan","deception"],"politicalBiases":["pro-South Korea","pro-US"]}],"title":"Proportional Representation as a Solution to Petty Redistricting","date":"2025-08-07T16:12:03-04:00"}
