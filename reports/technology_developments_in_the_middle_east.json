The equipment is used to automate machinery, aiding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. \"These high-precision components are often irreplaceable within advanced manufacturing processes, including missile production, drone assembly, and tank refurbishment,\" said Konrad Muzyka.

This trend reflects a broader market dynamic where Indian startups face funding challenges while Middle Eastern investors seek technology investments. The UAE, particularly Dubai, is becoming a hub for Indian businesses due to its favorable business environment, including tax incentives and minimal bureaucracy.
