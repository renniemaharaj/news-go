He claims PBMs inflate costs without transparency and that MFN would devastate innovation and economic growth. He advocates for PBM reform to lower drug costs.

It reveals high awareness (97%) but limited formal commitments (41%) in strategic documents.  Most organizations (90%) undertook ES actions, prioritizing digital transformation and facility management.  The study identifies the link between environmental and public health, economic factors, regulatory compliance, and corporate social responsibility as key drivers. Barriers include data collection challenges and competing priorities. The study suggests that healthcare organizations do not necessarily follow a linear or formalized pathway in adopting environmental sustainability practices. A national strategy could enhance scalability and support healthcare organizations in embedding sustainability more systematically.","images":["https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12913-025-13158-x/MediaObjects/12913_2025_13158_Fig1_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12913-025-13158-x/MediaObjects/12913_2025_13158_Fig2_HTML.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12913-025-13158-x/MediaObjects/12913_2025_13158_Fig3_HTML.png"],"href":"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13158-x","tags":["sustainability","healthcare","environment","italy"],"politicalBiases":["environmentalism","european union"]},{"title":"Medicare at 60: Care, Cost, Control","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"A discussion on Medicare's past, present, and future, featuring insights on cost control, care management, and the impact of Medicare Advantage plans.
