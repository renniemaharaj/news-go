He highlights the enthusiasm and lack of critique in media coverage, raising questions about the moral status of embryos used in the process, referencing Genesis 1:27 and Psalm 127:3. The article challenges readers to consider if such interventions align with God's intentions and warns against normalizing embryo manipulation, potentially deflecting from Godâ€™s plan for families, referencing Colossians 1:20.
