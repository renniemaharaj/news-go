He argues that both extremes demonize Israel, with the left using anti-imperialism and social justice, and the right employing nationalism and religious betrayal. He asserts this convergence is influenced by Islamic regimes and threatens Western solidarity with Israel, potentially leading to its delegitimization and destruction. \"If Western civilization falls, it won’t be because Islam defeated it in war. It will be because the West committed suicide through ideological betrayal, by embracing the very propaganda its enemies designed to destroy it.\"","images":["https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/danny-burmawi1753537684-200x200.jpg"],"href":"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/how-the-woke-right-joined-the-lefts-war-on-israel/","tags":["Israel","politics","deception","scripture"],"politicalBiases":["pro-Israel","conservative critique"]}],"title":"How the Woke Right Joined the Left’s War on Israel","date":"2025-07-26T14:52:25-04:00"}
