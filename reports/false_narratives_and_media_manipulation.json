The article claims TOI falsely attributed a CBI report to Mr. Satish Salian, Disha's father, and altered the article after receiving a legal notice to shift blame. The author quotes Adv. Ishwarlal Agarwal, who asserts, \"This is not just bad journalism, it is premeditated criminal fraud.\" This echoes the Bible's warning against bearing false witness (Exodus 20:16). Readers should verify these claims independently.","images":["https://rashidkhanpathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54011892295917.607ac066efd4f-768x480.webp"],"href":"https://rashidkhanpathan.com/criminal-conspiracy-and-fraudulent-reporting-and-dishonesty-of-times-of-india-and-vineet-jain-exposed-fake-cbi-report-used-to-defame-disha-salians-father-and-after-receipt-of-legal-notice/","tags":["deception","fraud","legal","journalism","criminality"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"Head in the Clouds: Extreme Weather and Conspiracy Theories","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This article discusses the rise of conspiracy theories surrounding extreme weather events, claiming governments or elites control the weather.
