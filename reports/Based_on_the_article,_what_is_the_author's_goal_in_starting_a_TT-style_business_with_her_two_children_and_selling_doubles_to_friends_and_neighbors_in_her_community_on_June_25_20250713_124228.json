That in TT would mean being out of work indefinitely, and I can't afford that luxury. I'm a single mother and I had to make the best decision for my children. They supported me at all times, and here we are together, trying to get ahead with honest work.”\nShe and her children lived in Rio Claro for four years, and then in Arima for another four.\n“During that time, I learned everything about Trinidadian food. I worked at The Cutting Block restaurant in the Eddie Hart Savannah, Tacarigua,” she said.\nHer speciality was preparing doubles for the restaurant's customers, which is why her idea for a business venture in her country was doubles.\nThe doubles are prepared just like in TT and are sold for US$1 each.\n“We cook everything just like in TT. We add channa, cucumber, chadon beni, tamarind sauce, mango sauce, hot sauce, chilli sauce, chicken, or meat.”\nShe said due to the success, she is considering adding duck and shrimp to her menu.\nShe said customers are so impressed that she can sell up to 250 doubles daily.\n“We opened a space on the porch of my house in the Monte Calvario community, Tucupita. Customers arrive here daily, already asking when we'll start selling.”\nMartinez has even managed to source condiments from TT, which are sold in her city due to the proximity between the two countries, to give it a true Trinidadian flavour.\n“There are many people here who order condiments from TT and sell them regularly. I must emphasise the flavour of Trinidadian condiments is better than those currently sold in my country.”\nAmong her regular customers, in addition to Venezuelans curious to try the doubles, are Trinidadians and Guyanese currently residing in Tucupita.\n“I could have started selling empanadas or typical Venezuelan dishes, but I wanted to do something different and thought of doubles. Many Venezuelans who have lived in TT love and miss the food. It has truly been a wonderful idea that, thank God, we have been able to make a reality.”\nMartinez said in addition to doubles, she also learned to cook BBQ chicken, pholourie, chicken feet with lemon, dhalpuri, buss-up-shut roti, jerk pork, macaroni salad, potato salad, among other Trinidadian dishes.\n“We are thinking of going further. We want to prepare these dishes for lunch so customers can choose according to their taste.”\nMartinez believes with her small business, she can not only help her family, but also please the palates.\n“I know we can offer more with hard work and dedication. I thank God and the customers who support us daily, and TT for teaching me a part of their culture I can now showcase in my own country.”\nA Venezuelan family who had been living and working in TT for eight years, started selling doubles in the city of Tucupita, Venezuela, and the business has become a huge success.\n","alignment":0,"summary":"I hope this summary meets your expectations.

They said the whale shark was under its jetty.\n“By the time I sent out my officers and they went out, it was already dead. But people have been saying they saw it there since Sunday. When we went it was already starting to decompose, so I think it's because it started to smell that the hotel called.”\nShe said, because of the decomposition, the IMA could not say conclusively what caused the death but it was suspected that the whale shark was hit by a boat.\nThere are over 900 species of fish in TT waters but only a few are harvested commercially. These include carite, king fish, snapper, dolphin fish, grunt, jacks, and salmon. Most of these have been recorded as overexploited or fully exploited, forcing fishermen to go further out to sea to make their catch.\n“It's about fisheries management. It's also about us trying to see if the other species that we have in our water could become more commercially viable. And the other thing the IMA is attempting to do is to start up a mariculture system to we farm the fish.”\nShe explained that the idea was to have the fish spawn and grow to a certain size at the IMA before putting them in cages in the ocean to grow. This would decrease the pressure on the natural stock while providing a secondary food source.\nThere are also over 25 species of shark in local waters. IMA senior research officer Farahnaz Solomon said the most common were the smooth hound, sharpnose, and bigger sharks like the black tip, Caribbean reef, tiger and bull sharks.\nSolomon said, “The majority of them are coastal, they are not offshore, and so they are caught by gill nets. We eat most of them.”\nApart from sharks, dolphins are often seen down the islands, and there are also pilot whales. Juman said with pilot whales, if the leader is unwell it tends to beach itself and the others follow. TT has a Marine Mammal Stranding Network comprising people from various industries, including the School of Veterinary Medicine at UWI, who look for the next leader and guide it out so the rest will follow it back into open waters or generally assist marine animals.\nSea turtles are another common marine creature found locally. These include leatherback, green and hawksbill turtles. Juman noted that while the latter two used to be common in Chaguaramas, they are now mostly found on the reefs in Tobago.\n“Green turtles in particular, they feed on sea grasses, something we call Thalassia testudinum or turtle grass, because the turtles feed on it. We used to have turtle grass here in Chaguaramas, but we've lost most of it due to build development, pollution, reclamation, boats anchoring and destroying the grass if it hits the bottom, all those kind of things.”\nNow there is but a sparse population of Thalassia in Williams Bay. There used to be extensive sea grass beds in the area, and in the past, she would see a lot of sea horses. It may still have them, but she has not seen them in a few years.\nThe only extensive sea grass beds remaining in TT is in the Bon Accord Lagoon and Buccoo Reef in Tobago. Many species live within these grass beds and in the soil.\n“When you have these sea grasses, they provide a nursery for juvenile species – fish, lobster, shrimp. So you used to get all the different species of grunts and snappers, different types of shrimp and crabs. We used to get the fighting conch and murex and different types of bivalves (a type of mollusc).\n“And because you have all these invertebrates in the grass bed, fish would come in to feed. So you would get things like the stingrays coming in to feed on the sea grass beds.”\nShe stressed the need to protect these marine habitats because if they are degraded or destroyed, the marine life there will be lost.\nCoral reefs also support many marine animals, including manta rays, sea urchins and star fish. However, last November TT had one of its worst coral bleaching events as sea surface temperatures were above 29 degrees Celsius, which negatively impacted the reefs.\nCorals, which are also animals, have microscopic plants in their tissues which help nourish them and give them their colour. When it gets too hot, which is part of the impacts of climate change, they expel the plants.\n“We in Trinidad, there's certain things that we have no control over, like certain elements of climate change. But there are things that we have control over, like pollution.\n“So when we talk about building resilience of our ecosystems, we remove the impacts that we have control over. So we put in management, we remove those impacts, we make our systems more resilient so when they have impacts from climate change, they're more likely to survive or bounce back after an event.”\nJuman said the influx of sargassum seaweed was also linked to climate change, and when it comes in, it impacts local ecosystems.\nShe recalled that in 2015, when sargassum covered several areas in Tobago, the seagrass beds were destroyed when the sargassum blocked out the light.\nRecently there was a lot of sargassum beaching in Matura. Members of Nature Seekers had to remove it so the leatherbacks could come onto the sand to nest.\n“The other thing too, we haven't done much research on it but it is an issue, is that, when sargassum is out in the ocean, it's a habitat, it's a nursery, it's functioning there.\n“But sometimes it becomes problematic when it comes onshore or near shore. When it comes on land, you don't know what other organisms could be coming with it.”\nAnother impact of climate change is ocean acidification, which will impact various sponges, corals and mollusks. Although the IMA has not done the local research on this as yet, it is monitoring the issue.\nThe IMA has, however, done research on alien invasive species such as the lion fish. Juman said before the lion fish, the green mussel was an invasive species. However, people started to eat it, which controlled the population, and it was eventually considered naturalised.\nThe IMA has been encouraging people to eat the lion fish for years and is in the process of developing a fish pot to more easily catch it. They are currently working with fishermen to test them.\nThe institute is also on the lookout for a coral disease called stony coral tissue loss disease, which is currently in Grenada and has decimated much of the hard coral species in the region. She said it is just a matter of time until it arrives here.\nIn the mangroves, there are manatees, crabs, mussels and oysters. Juman added that mangroves provide many ecological services, such as protecting the coastlines and providing nurseries for fish and shellfish. Recent information indicates they capture and store two to five times more carbon dioxide than other ecosystems in their trunks and in the sediment. If they are disturbed, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere.\nWith climate change, pollution and human activities continuing to impact TT’s marine environments, experts at the IMA stress that the protection and management of these ecosystems is no longer optional. It is mandatory.\nFrom conserving seagrass beds and coral reefs to responsibly harvesting marine species and controlling invasive ones, the choices made today will determine whether these rich and diverse waters continue to sustain the country’s food security, economy and natural heritage for generations to come.\n","alignment":0,"summary":"","images":["https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/themes/newsday-2020/images/newsday-n-touch.png","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243135-1024x684.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243136-1024x683.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243063-1024x683.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243143-1024x666.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243191-658x1024.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243145-1024x683.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243193-1024x683.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243146-1024x731.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243195-1-1024x903.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243190-1024x683.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24243065-683x1024.jpg","https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/themes/newsday-2020/images/newsday-n-touch.png"],"href":"https://newsday.co.tt/2025/07/13/sea-creatures-that-roam-trinidad-and-tobago-waters/","tags":null,"politicalBiases":null}],"title":"Based on the article, what is the author's goal in starting a TT-style business with her two children and selling doubles to friends and neighbors in her community on June 25?\r\n","date":"2025-07-13T12:42:28-04:00"}
