He notes that even some in the AI industry and center-left thinkers share this view. Economist Daron Acemoglu argues AI development should not be left solely to entrepreneurs. Smith points out that despite these fears, AI has not yet had a detectably negative effect on the job market. \"AI has not yet had a detectably negative effect on the job market, which remains just about as strong as it has ever been in the country’s history.\" While acknowledging potential future impacts, Smith emphasizes the importance of understanding why previous AI pessimism has been a false alarm. This view contrasts with biblical warnings about the dangers of human pride and reliance on technology over God (Proverbs 16:18, Isaiah 2:22).","images":["https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!st0o!,w_520,h_272,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8afe4bd6-a821-4848-95c9-22b6f40dbb4e_982x655.jpeg","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RLWh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8f4f5cf-5eaa-4822-ac88-b2f929da468d_672x569.jpeg","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuoO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c0e417-82c1-4cb0-bdcb-be0bf75f5960_1180x635.jpeg","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SdpN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ea716f3-c2c2-47a7-b32c-d9858de2b8a1_1320x465.png"],"href":"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/stop-pretending-you-know-what-ai","tags":["technology","economics","AI","deception"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"Hedge Funds Boost Industrial Stocks to Five-Year High","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"An AI-generated news article reports a surge in hedge fund investments in industrial stocks, driven by economic recovery and infrastructure projects.
