The author uses a thought experiment where someone wakes up every 7.93 years from 1970 to 2025, highlighting the unrecognizable changes in technology and society within short election cycles. He argues that technology drives social change, not democratic principles, leading to governments reacting to unforeseen events rather than leading with strategy. The author questions the exchange of value in the digital age, where \"free\" services generate immense wealth by refining algorithms and manipulating society for profit. Tasic calls for citizens to regain influence over societal development, as current democratic institutions and greedy billionaires are insufficient. He also references a discussion between Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk on AI's impact on the labor market, emphasizing the paradox of billionaires recognizing the problem but politicians being terrified of extreme solutions. The author concludes that democracy, as we understand it, was quietly killed by technology in 1,750,000,000 seconds. Reader is encouraged to remember that this is simply a summary, and they should refer to the original source and proceed with spiritual discernment.","images":["https://vreme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pexels-piotrbaranowski-22763683-scaled.jpg"],"href":"https://vreme.com/en/drustvo/kako-je-tehnologija-unistila-demokratiju-za-1-750-000-000-sekundi/","tags":["technology","democracy","artificial intelligence","politics","deception"],"politicalBiases":["techno-critical","questions the current state of democracy","challenges the power of corporations and billionaires"]},{"title":"Shifting Global Power Balance Favors China","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"The article suggests a shift in the global balance of power towards China, driven by trade imbalances and geopolitical confrontations.

The article highlights Nvidia's approval to sell H20 chips to China, a reversal of the Trump administration's ban. Some U.S. media outlets express concerns over losing the AI lead, while the author attributes these fears to Cold War and zero-sum game mentalities. Yang suggests the U.S. fears losing the lucrative Chinese market but is also wary of strengthening China's tech capabilities. The piece warns against \"playing the victim\" and promotes cooperation over conflict. Readers should approach viewpoints from CGTN with caution and spiritual discernment, remembering to prioritize biblical truth.
