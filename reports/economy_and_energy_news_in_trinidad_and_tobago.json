The decision follows the replacement of the Bermuda Immigration and Protection Order 2025 by the Ministry of Economy and Labour. This change aligns Bermuda with recent visa policy adjustments by the United Kingdom and Ireland. Nationals can enter Bermuda with valid travel authorization to Canada, the United States, or the United Kingdom, or with a letter verifying their status as a spouse of a Bermudian or affiliation under Section 11(5) of the 1968 Bermuda Constitution Order.
