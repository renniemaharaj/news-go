It attributes this disparity to factors like cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, \"diseases of despair,\" healthcare access, and socioeconomic inequality. The article highlights that Americans are living shorter, sicker lives despite higher healthcare spending. It suggests addressing chronic disease, the opioid crisis, healthcare access, and inequality to improve longevity. While the article raises valid concerns about public health, it lacks a spiritual perspective on the value of life and the importance of faith in times of suffering.

However, experts emphasize that research is lacking, and vibration plates alone won't replace traditional exercise for weight loss.
