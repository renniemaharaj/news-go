Administrator Lee Zeldin claims this will enhance the agency's ability to protect human health and the environment. However, environmental advocates, like Kyla Bennett, express concern that cutting the research office could lead to worse climate change, unhealthy air and water, and an unhealthy food supply. True stewardship involves diligent care and preservation, reflecting God's command in Genesis 2:15 to 'dress it and to keep it'.","images":["https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/2b/4b/46ced8214c4293a7b03fb24d2b96/ap23277823317577.jpg","https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/cd/1e/6999bb4b46c9889bf3c06703d141/ap25164751519766.jpg","https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/13/5e/d5a8c9d446f981764a26931f6643/shutterstock-2333643265.jpg"],"href":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/science-and-tech/environment/epa-is-closing-its-research-and-development-office-as-part-of-a-major-agency-cut-down","tags":["environment","policy","stewardship","climate change"],"politicalBiases":[]},{"title":"Fossil Fuel Lobby's Climate Playbook and Its Impact on Energy Transition Investing","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"An AI analysis of the fossil fuel industry's lobbying tactics in 2025, highlighting their efforts to delay climate action and mask risks to their business model.

It highlights issues such as the environmental impact of AI ('AI devours the same physical resources weâ€™re trying to conserve'), the exploitation of communities in the Global South for raw materials, and the perpetuation of old hierarchies. It advocates for community-driven alternatives that prioritize equity, local knowledge, and shared ownership, warning that 'Climate tech keeps old hierarchies intact, just in shinier packaging.' The article challenges the notion that technology alone can solve the climate crisis and calls for a focus on systemic change and justice-centered solutions.","images":["https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Article-Cover-Image-Export-Template-21.jpg"],"href":"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/they-say-climate-tech-will-save-us-but-who-will-save-us-from-climate-tech/","tags":["environmentalism","social justice","deception","climate change"],"politicalBiases":["progressive","social justice"]},{"title":"Trusted Climate Data for Effective Policy: A Roadmap for Action","commentaries":null,"alignment":1,"summary":"This report from Stanford Law School discusses the need for \"trusted climate data\" to fulfill carbon emission reduction pledges.
