The authors argue that shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy challenges the state's basic functions of ensuring economic growth, maintaining legitimacy, and providing security. This gap between ambitious targets and actual policies is intensified by climate backsliding pressure. While the aim to reduce emissions may seem aligned with stewardship, the reliance on renewable energy and the challenges to economic growth can lead to societal and political instability, potentially undermining true, lasting solutions found in faith and reliance on God.","images":["https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41558-025-02394-y/MediaObjects/41558_2025_2394_Fig1_HTML.png"],"href":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02394-y","tags":["climate change","sustainability","policy","economic impact"],"politicalBiases":["environmentalism","academic"]},{"title":"Climate and Environment Updates: Addressing Global Challenges","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This ABC News compilation highlights various climate-related issues and initiatives.
