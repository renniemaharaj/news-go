Weisenburger of Detroit terminated Ralph Martin, Eduardo Echeverria, and Edward Peters from Sacred Heart Major Seminary due to concerns over their theological perspectives and criticisms of Pope Francis. Martin cited concerns about 'confusion and disunity' caused by some of the Pope's actions. Echeverria questioned the orthodoxy of 'Amoris Laetitia.' Peters criticized changes to the Church's teaching on the death penalty. This action aligns with a broader trend of restricting traditional practices, as seen with the limitation of the Latin Mass. Believers must discern truth using Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16) and test all things (1 Thessalonians 5:21).","images":["https://cdn-ilakidp.nitrocdn.com/bfnzjaxZoOFjvBtVsgetlrZENNoYMTOq/assets/images/optimized/rev-6617b95/www.osvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4bca1d49-0823-4e7a-bf9d-458cc0828502.jpg","https://cdn-ilakidp.nitrocdn.com/bfnzjaxZoOFjvBtVsgetlrZENNoYMTOq/assets/images/optimized/rev-6617b95/www.osvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/boguslaw.jpg"],"href":"https://www.osvnews.com/detroit-archbishop-fires-theologians-ralph-martin-eduardo-echeverria-from-seminary/","tags":["theology","Catholicism","doctrine","Pope Francis","discernment","apostasy"],"politicalBiases":[]}],"title":"NFL Training Camp 2025: News, Notes, and Injuries","date":"2025-07-26T14:49:49-04:00"}
