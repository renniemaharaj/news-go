{"searchQuery":"Faith and Ethics in the Digital Age","results":[{"title":"The Facebook Effect: How Mark Zuckerberg Fashioned a Generation in His Own Image","commentaries":null,"alignment":3,"summary":"This article discusses how Mark Zuckerberg's social media platforms have significantly shaped Gen Z, leading to a generation potentially lacking in emotional intelligence and genuine interpersonal skills. It argues that the constant exposure to strategically curated online personas and the platforms' 'Community Standards' have made young people more attuned to online metrics and less focused on real-world interactions. The author suggests a need for a greater emphasis on physical, tangible, and person-to-person interactions to counteract the digital influence. However, the article lacks a biblical perspective on identity and purpose, failing to address the spiritual implications of relying on social media for self-definition as outlined in Romans 12:2, 'And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.'","images":[],"href":"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/facebook-effect-how-mark-zuckerberg-shaped-generation-z/105558698","tags":["social media","technology","ethics","deception","idolatry"],"politicalBiases":[]}],"title":"The Facebook Effect: How Mark Zuckerberg Fashioned a Generation in His Own Image","date":"2025-07-22T07:13:30-04:00"}
