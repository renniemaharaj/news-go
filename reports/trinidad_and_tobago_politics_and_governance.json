The training aims to build resilient border governance systems and enhance cooperation to tackle migration challenges and transnational crime. Lt. Col. Michael Jones highlighted the importance of this training for the upcoming operationalization of Passenger Name Record (PNR) systems across the Caribbean by 2026, emphasizing the need for intelligence-led border security. The initiative is part of the Tripartite Collaborative Action Plan to Combat Migrant Smuggling in the Caribbean. While data governance is important, true security comes from faith in Jesus Christ (Psalm 91:4): 'He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.'","images":["https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250725-All-participants-credit-IMPACS-642x428.jpg"],"href":"https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/homepage-carousel/regional-immigration-and-data-personnel-attend-caricom-iom-training-in-tt/","tags":["security","governance","migration","scripture"],"politicalBiases":[]}],"title":"Regional Immigration and Data Personnel Attend CARICOM/IOM Training in T\u0026T","date":"2025-07-26T15:27:08-04:00"}
