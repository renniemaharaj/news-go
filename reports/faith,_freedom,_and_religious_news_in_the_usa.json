Bremerton School District and Groff v. Dejoy. The memo outlines permitted religious conduct for federal employees, including displaying religious items and engaging in religious conversations.

The group claims it helps 'access the divine' and 'alleviate human suffering'. Judge Jill Parrish granted a preliminary injunction, stating the county imposed a 'substantial burden' on religious freedom. Psilocybin remains illegal in Utah under most circumstances.

USCIRF urges the State Department to designate Turkey for its Special Watch List due to ongoing violations under IRFA. The Turkish government's interference in religious life affects Alevis, Christians, Jews, and Sunni Muslims.
